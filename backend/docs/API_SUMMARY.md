# 📚 Wiyata LMS - API Endpoints Summary

Base URL: `http://localhost:8080/api`

## 🔐 Authentication

**Public Endpoints (No Auth Required):**

- `POST /login` - User login
- `POST /register` - Public user self-registration (plain global account only). Auto-logs in and issues a best-effort email verification token/email.
- `POST /verify-email` - Consume a single-use, hashed, expiring email verification token; stamps `usr_email_verified_at`
- `GET /invitations/:token` - Validate an invitation token and return safe invitation metadata
- `POST /invitations/:token/accept` - Accept an invitation, set password for new/no-password users, and create membership

**All other endpoints require JWT authentication.**

**Authentication Header:**

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

**Context Headers:**

```
SchoolId: <active-school-id>
Active-Role: admin|teacher|student
```

`Active-Role` is optional during migration. When present, school-scoped routes
authorize only the selected role after verifying it belongs to the current user
in the active school. When absent, legacy multi-role authorization is preserved
temporarily.

**Protected Context Endpoint:**

- `GET /me/context` - Refresh current memberships, global roles, default context, and email verification status (`emailVerified`, `emailVerifiedAt`) from backend authority — the single source of truth the frontend relies on
- `POST /me/resend-verification` - Reissue a verification token for the current (authenticated, not-yet-verified) user; invalidates prior outstanding tokens

**Realtime Sidebar Stream:**

- `GET /events/sidebar?token=&schoolId=` - Server-Sent Events stream for sidebar badge invalidation events (`notification_changed`, `feed_changed`) in the active school context

---

## 🏫 Schools

- `POST /schools` - Self-service Create School. Gated by `RequireVerifiedUser()` (any authenticated user with a verified email, not a role check) — creates the school and enrolls the caller as its Admin atomically, in one DB transaction (School + SchoolUser + UserRole).

Notes are material-only for MVP. They are scoped to the JWT user and active `SchoolId`, require active student enrollment in the material's class, and are not accessible to teacher/admin roles.

## 🗓️ Academic Activity

- `GET /academic-activity?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD` - Get normalized, actionable academic activity for the current active-school student or teacher. Defaults to today through today + 7 days and supports a maximum 60-day range.

Academic Activity is not notification/feed/calendar storage. It merges academic sources into one response for future My Day, Activity, and calendar marker UI. Student activity currently includes assignment deadlines, new materials, class feed posts, and graded assignments. Teacher activity currently includes received submissions, pending review submissions, assignment deadlines, and feed comments. Access follows active school membership plus active enrollment/teaching rules.

## 💬 Chat

- `GET /ws/chat?token=&schoolId=` - Connect WebSocket realtime transport for chat `new_message`, `message_read`, and `room_updated` events
- `GET /chat/rooms?search=` - List room sekolah, grup kustom yang bisa diakses, dan direct message aktif; `search` juga mencocokkan nama/email target DM
- `GET /chat/members?search=&excludeRoomId=` - Search active school members for chat picker grup/DM, optionally excluding active members of a room
- `POST /chat/school/open` - Open or create the active school's main chat room
- `POST /chat/dm/open` - Open or reuse a direct message room with one active member in the same school
- `POST /chat/groups` - Create custom group room with active school members
- `GET /chat/groups/:roomId` - Get group room info, creator, admins, and active members
- `PATCH /chat/groups/:roomId` - Rename custom group room as a group admin
- `POST /chat/groups/:roomId/leave` - Leave a custom group room

- `PATCH /chat/rooms/:roomId/read` - Mark accessible room as read with optional validated `lastReadMessageId`

Chat MVP supports text messages and upload-first file/image attachments. Active school admins, teachers, and
students can participate in the school-wide room if their school membership is
active. Custom group rooms are limited to selected active school members through
`chat_room_members.left_at IS NULL`, with admin-only rename/member management and
automatic ownership transfer when the creator leaves. Direct message rooms are
limited to exactly two active members in the same active school and are reused
idempotently when the same pair opens DM again. Unread counts exclude messages
sent by the current user and are based on `chat_read_receipts.last_read_msg_id`
or `last_read_at`. WebSocket in Sprint 18B is event transport only for
`new_message`, `message_read`, and `room_updated`; message creation still uses
REST. The frontend refreshes room summaries on websocket events plus
visibility/context changes rather than periodic polling. Attachment messages
upload files through `POST /api/medias/upload`, then send `mediaIds` to chat;
`new_message` includes attachment metadata. Current storage URLs may be public
depending on provider, with signed/protected downloads deferred. It does not
enable subject/class rooms, typing indicators, message delete, or
notifications.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

### Authentication

- JWT-based authentication
- Token expiry: 24 hours
- Public endpoints: login, register, verify-email, invitation metadata/accept
- All other endpoints protected
- Self-service school creation (`POST /schools`) additionally requires a verified email (`RequireVerifiedUser()`), not a specific role

### Pagination

Most list endpoints support:

- `?page=1` - Page number (default: 1)
- `?limit=20` - Items per page (default: varies)
- `?search=keyword` - Search filter

### Response Patterns

- **Header Pattern**: List responses include parent context (School, Class, SubjectClass)
- **Soft Delete**: Most delete operations are soft deletes (can be restored)
- **Student Material Notes**: Note deletion is an intentional hard delete for the material-only MVP
- **Upsert Logic**: Submissions and assessments auto-update if already exist

### Timestamp Policy

- Schema timestamp columns use PostgreSQL `timestamptz`.
- Backend stores timestamp values as instants, not Asia/Jakarta wall-clock literals.
- API timestamp responses use RFC3339 timezone-aware strings.
- Frontend displays timestamp values in the user's/local display timezone.
- Assignment deadlines are instants. The MVP teacher form sends deadline input with the Jakarta offset (`+07:00`) so the selected school-local time is preserved.
- Academic Activity `date` remains date-only (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and is not a timestamp.

### File Handling

- **Multipart Upload**: Direct file upload with auto-detection
- **Metadata Only**: Record already-uploaded files (Supabase/S3)
- **Inline Media**: Create media records within material/assignment creation

### Error Handling

- Standardized error responses (no raw DB errors exposed)
- Validation errors with field-specific messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
