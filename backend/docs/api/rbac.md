## Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mengamankan API endpoints berdasarkan role user di setiap school. Sistem mendukung multi-school dengan role berbeda per school.

### Roles

| Role          | Scope                                   | Permissions                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `super_admin` | **System-wide** (bukan school-specific) | System management: create/manage schools, roles, super admins. Read access ke semua sekolah. **TIDAK bisa** melakukan operasi akademik (create assignments, materials, dll) tanpa role sekolah. |
| `admin`       | School-specific                         | Manage sekolah tertentu (academic years, terms, users, subjects, classes)                                                                                                                       |
| `teacher`     | School-specific                         | Manage kelas, materials, assignments yang diajar                                                                                                                                                |
| `student`     | School-specific                         | Akses read-only + submit assignment                                                                                                                                                             |

**Catatan Penting:**

- `super_admin` adalah **admin sistem aplikasi**, bukan admin sekolah
- `super_admin` bisa VIEW data semua sekolah (monitoring/troubleshooting)
- `super_admin` TIDAK bisa CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE konten akademik tanpa role sekolah
- Untuk operasi akademik, super_admin harus di-enroll sebagai `admin` atau `teacher` di sekolah tersebut
- Chat akademik MVP adalah school-wide chat. Semua member aktif sekolah dapat
  ikut. Super admin tidak ikut kecuali juga memiliki membership aktif di sekolah
  tersebut.

---

## 3. Super Admin Management

### Bootstrap School Tenant with Initial Admin

Create a new school tenant and assign one initial school admin in one database
transaction. This is internal Super Admin MVP onboarding, not public landing-page
school request onboarding.

- **URL:** `/super-admin/school-bootstrap`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Auth:** Required (`super_admin` on system school `sch_code = "000000"` only)

**Create new admin user:**

```json
{
  "school": {
    "schoolName": "SMA Wiyata",
    "schoolCode": "sma-wiyata",
    "schoolAddress": "Jl. Pendidikan No. 1",
    "schoolEmail": "admin@sma.sch.id",
    "schoolPhone": "08123456789",
    "schoolWebsite": "https://sma.sch.id"
  },
  "adminUser": {
    "mode": "new",
    "fullName": "Admin Sekolah",
    "email": "admin@sma.sch.id",
    "password": "InitialPassword123!"
  }
}
```

**Use existing global user:**

```json
{
  "school": {
    "schoolName": "SMA Wiyata",
    "schoolCode": "sma-wiyata",
    "schoolAddress": "Jl. Pendidikan No. 1",
    "schoolEmail": "admin@sma.sch.id",
    "schoolPhone": "08123456789"
  },
  "adminUser": {
    "mode": "existing",
    "userId": "uuid"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "school": {
    "schoolId": "uuid",
    "schoolName": "SMA Wiyata",
    "schoolCode": "sma-wiyata"
  },
  "adminUser": {
    "userId": "uuid",
    "fullName": "Admin Sekolah",
    "email": "admin@sma.sch.id",
    "isActive": true
  },
  "schoolUserId": "uuid",
  "assignedRoles": ["admin"]
}
```

**Behavior:**

- Creates the school tenant.
- Creates a new global user or uses an existing active user.
- Creates `school_users` membership for the new school.
- Assigns only the `admin` role to that school membership.
- Rolls back the whole transaction if any step fails.
- Does not create public school request records.
- Does not assign `super_admin`.

---

### Create Super Admin

Create a new super admin user (automatically enrolled to "admin" school with super_admin role).

- **URL:** `/super-admin`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Auth:** Required (super_admin only)
- **Body:**

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@admin.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Super admin created successfully"
}
```

**Note:** This endpoint can only be accessed by existing super_admin. For the first super_admin, use manual setup (see section 6).

## 4. RBAC Middleware

### School Context Header

**All protected endpoints require school context via:**

**Priority 1: Header (Recommended)**

```
SchoolId: uuid-school-id
```

**Priority 2: URL Parameter (Fallback)**

```
/api/schools/:schoolCode/...
```

### Request Example

```bash
POST /api/classes
Authorization: Bearer <token>
SchoolId: uuid-school-id
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "cls_code": "12-IPA-1",
  "cls_title": "Kelas 12 IPA 1"
}
```

### School Management

| Endpoint               | Method | super_admin | admin | teacher | student |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| `/schools/:schoolCode` | GET    | 📖          | 📖    | 📖      | 📖      |
| `/schools/:schoolCode` | PATCH  | ❌\*        | ✅    | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/schools/:schoolCode` | DELETE | ❌\*        | ✅    | ❌      | ❌      |

\*Super admin harus enroll sebagai admin di sekolah tersebut

### School Members

| Endpoint                                      | Method | super_admin | admin | teacher | student |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| `/admin/school-members`                       | GET    | ❌          | ✅    | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/admin/school-members`                       | POST   | ❌          | ✅    | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/admin/school-members/:schoolUserId`         | DELETE | ❌          | ✅    | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/admin/school-members/:schoolUserId/restore` | PATCH  | ❌          | ✅    | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/admin/school-members/import/preview`        | POST   | ❌          | ✅    | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/admin/school-members/import/commit`         | POST   | ❌          | ✅    | ❌      | ❌      |

Warga sekolah hanya dikelola pada sekolah aktif milik Admin Sekolah. Role yang
diterima hanya `student`, `teacher`, dan `admin`; `super_admin` ditolak.
Membership aktif berarti `school_users.deleted_at IS NULL`. Menghapus warga
dari sekolah hanya mengisi `school_users.deleted_at`; akun global di `users`
tidak dihapus. Import/manual add dapat memulihkan membership yang pernah
soft-deleted pada sekolah aktif.

\*Teacher material/assignment creation, mutation, assignment detail, submission detail, and assessment access is limited to subject classes taught by the current teacher in the active `SchoolId` context.
**Admin and shared media access is scoped to active `SchoolId`. \***Student material/assignment read access is limited to subject classes in classes where the student is enrolled. \***\*Student submission mutation is limited to the current JWT user's own submission in the active school.
\*\*\***Non-admin media deletion is limited to media owned/uploaded by the current JWT user in the active school.
**\*\***Student material notes are private to the current JWT user. Access requires active `SchoolId` and active student enrollment (`left_at IS NULL`) in the material or requested subject class's class. Material note access excludes deleted materials, collection responses include only the current user's notes, notes are not exposed to teacher/admin roles, and deletion is a hard delete.
**\*\*\***Chat MVP is school-wide and scoped to active `SchoolId`. Access requires active school membership (`school_users.deleted_at IS NULL`). Super admin does not participate unless also an active member of the active school.

Media IDs attached to materials, assignments, and submissions are validated before linking: media must exist, belong to the active school, and be attachable by the actor. Non-admin users can attach only their own uploaded media; admins can attach active-school media where admin mutation is allowed. Assignment categories used by assignments must belong to the active school.

### Subject Class Assignment

| Endpoint                          | Method | super_admin | admin | teacher | student |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| `/subject-classes/assign`         | POST   | ❌          | ✅\*  | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/subject-classes/class/:classId` | GET    | 📖          | 📖    | 📖      | 📖      |
| `/subject-classes/:id`            | GET    | 📖          | 📖    | 📖      | 📖      |
| `/subject-classes/:id`            | PATCH  | ❌          | ✅\*  | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/subject-classes/:id`            | DELETE | ❌          | ✅\*  | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/subject-classes/my-teaching`    | GET    | ❌          | ❌    | 📖\*\*  | ❌      |

\*Admin subject_class assignment requires active `SchoolId`; class, subject, and teacher school_user must belong to the active school. The teacher school_user must have school role `teacher` and must already be enrolled in the class with `class_role = teacher`.
Subject_class unassign is admin-only and active-school scoped. It is allowed only for empty setup mistakes; the API blocks removal when the subject_class already has materials or assignments.

\*\*Teacher workspace access uses JWT user identity plus active `SchoolId`; teachers only see subject classes they teach while still actively enrolled in the class as `teacher` (`left_at IS NULL`).

\*Student gradebook access is current-user only. The student identity comes from JWT, the school context comes from `SchoolId`, and the class must be a class where the current student is enrolled.
Assessment weight management is admin-only for MVP. Weights are subject-level, school-scoped through subject/category ownership, and are used for provisional weighted grades.

### Feeds

| Endpoint                  | Method | super_admin | admin  | teacher  | student  |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| `/feeds`                  | POST   | ❌          | ✅\*   | ✅\*     | ❌       |
| `/feeds/class/:classId`   | GET    | ❌          | 📖\*   | 📖\*     | 📖\*     |
| `/feeds/:id`              | GET    | ❌          | 📖\*   | 📖\*     | 📖\*     |
| `/feeds/:id`              | PATCH  | ❌          | ✅\*   | ✅\*     | ❌       |
| `/feeds/:id`              | DELETE | ❌          | ✅\*   | ✅\*     | ❌       |
| `/comments`               | POST   | ❌          | ✅\*\* | ✅\*\*   | ✅\*\*   |
| `/comments?type=...&id=`   | GET    | ❌          | 📖\*\* | 📖\*\*   | 📖\*\*   |
| `/comments/:id`           | GET    | ❌          | 📖\*\* | 📖\*\*   | 📖\*\*   |
| `/comments/:id`           | PATCH  | ❌          | ❌     | ✅\*\*\* | ✅\*\*\* |
| `/comments/:id`           | DELETE | ❌          | ✅\*\* | ✅\*\*\* | ✅\*\*\* |

\*Feed access is scoped to active `SchoolId`. Feed is class-level. Admin can manage feeds in active-school classes. Teacher can create/read/update/delete only in classes they actively teach, and teacher update/delete is limited to their own feed posts. Student can read only feeds from classes where the current student has active enrollment (`left_at IS NULL`). Feed attachments, comments UI, reactions, and realtime are deferred from the MVP.

\*\*Comments support `feed`, `material`, and `assignment` sources for MVP. Admin can access active-school comments. Teacher access requires teaching the source class/subject class. Student access requires active enrollment (`left_at IS NULL`) in the source class/subject class. `submission` and nested `comment` discussions are post-MVP and rejected.

\*\*\*Teacher/student comment update/delete is limited to their own comments.

### User Management

| Endpoint                     | Method | super_admin | admin | teacher | student |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| `/users`                     | POST   | ✅          | ❌    | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/users`                     | GET    | 📖          | ✅    | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/users/:id`                 | GET    | 📖          | ❌    | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/users/:id`                 | PATCH  | ✅          | ❌    | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/users/change-password/:id` | PATCH  | ✅          | ❌    | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/users/:id`                 | DELETE | ✅          | ❌    | ❌      | ❌      |

Global user creation is platform scope and only allowed for a `super_admin` membership
on the system school where `schools.sch_code = "000000"`.
School admins manage existing global users as school memberships and assign roles in
their active school context.
Public `/register` remains available for users creating their own plain global
account, but it does not grant school membership, roles, or enrollment.

`users.deleted_at` applies to the global login account. `school_users.deleted_at`
applies only to one school membership and must be filtered out for active school
contexts, role checks, and tenant-scoped member lists.

### Enrollment

| Endpoint           | Method | super_admin | admin | teacher | student |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| `/enrollments`     | GET    | 📖\*        | 📖\*  | 📖\*    | 📖\*    |
| `/enrollments`     | POST   | ❌          | ✅\*  | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/enrollments/:id` | PATCH  | ❌          | ✅\*  | ❌      | ❌      |
| `/enrollments/:id` | DELETE | ❌          | ✅\*  | ❌      | ❌      |

\*Enrollment access is scoped to the active `SchoolId`. Classes, school users,
and enrollment records must belong to the active school. Active enrollment means
`left_at IS NULL`; unenroll sets `left_at = now()` instead of deleting the row.
Re-enroll clears `left_at` on the same row and preserves the original
`joined_at`. Admin unenroll preserves academic history and blocks teacher removal
while the teacher is still assigned to any subject_class in the same class.

## 6. Setup & Testing

### Initial Setup (First Super Admin)

**Option 1: Via API (3 steps)**

1. **Create User**

```bash
POST /api/register
{
  "fullName": "Super Admin",
  "email": "admin@system.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

2. **Get School "admin" ID**

```bash
GET /api/schools
# Find school with name "admin", copy sch_id
```

3. **Enroll to admin school**

```bash
POST /api/school-users/enroll
{
  "scu_usr_id": "<user-id>",
  "scu_sch_id": "<admin-school-id>"
}
# Copy scu_id from response
```

4. **Get super_admin role ID**

```bash
GET /api/rbac/roles
# Find role with name "super_admin", copy rol_id
```

5. **Assign super_admin role**

```bash
POST /api/rbac/user-roles
{
  "schoolUserId": "<scu-id>",
  "roleId": "<super-admin-role-id>"
}
```

**Option 2: Via SQL (Quick)**

```sql
-- 1. Create user
INSERT INTO edv.users (usr_id, usr_nama_lengkap, usr_email, usr_password, is_active)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'Super Admin', 'admin@system.com', '<hashed-password>', true);

-- 2. Get IDs
SELECT usr_id FROM edv.users WHERE usr_email = 'admin@system.com';
SELECT sch_id FROM edv.schools WHERE sch_name = 'admin';
SELECT rol_id FROM edv.roles WHERE rol_name = 'super_admin';

-- 3. Enroll to admin school
INSERT INTO edv.school_users (scu_id, scu_usr_id, scu_sch_id)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), '<user-id>', '<admin-school-id>');

-- 4. Assign role
INSERT INTO edv.user_roles (urol_id, urol_scu_id, urol_rol_id)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), '<school-user-id>', '<role-id>');
```

### Create Additional Super Admins

Once you have one super_admin, use the endpoint:

```bash
POST /api/rbac/super-admin
Authorization: Bearer <super-admin-token>
SchoolId: <admin-school-id>

{
  "fullName": "Another Super Admin",
  "email": "admin2@system.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

This automatically:

- Creates user
- Enrolls to "admin" school
- Assigns super_admin role

### Initial Setup (Roles)

```bash
POST /api/rbac/roles
{
  "roleName": "super_admin"
}
```

2. **Enroll User to School**

```bash
POST /api/school-users/enroll
{
  "scu_usr_id": "user-uuid",
  "scu_sch_id": "school-uuid"
}
```

3. **Assign Role**

```bash
POST /api/rbac/user-roles
{
  "schoolUserId": "school-user-uuid",
  "roleId": "role-uuid"
}
```

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// 1. User login
const { token } = await login(email, password);

// 2. Get user's schools
const schools = await fetch(`/api/school-users/user/${userId}`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});

// 3. User selects a school
const selectedSchoolId = schools[0].school.sch_id;

// 4. Make requests with SchoolId header
const response = await fetch("/api/classes", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    SchoolId: selectedSchoolId,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    cls_code: "12-IPA-1",
    cls_title: "Kelas 12 IPA 1",
  }),
});
```

### Test Examples

**Test as Admin (Success)**

```bash
POST /api/classes
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
SchoolId: <school-id>

{
  "cls_code": "12-IPA-1",
  "cls_title": "Kelas 12 IPA 1"
}

# Response: 200 OK
```

**Test as Student (Fail)**

```bash
POST /api/classes
Authorization: Bearer <student-token>
SchoolId: <school-id>

{
  "cls_code": "12-IPA-1",
  "cls_title": "Kelas 12 IPA 1"
}

# Response: 403 Forbidden
{
  "error": "Forbidden: insufficient permissions"
}
```

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Multi-School Support

- User dapat memiliki role berbeda di sekolah berbeda
- Frontend mengirim `SchoolId` header untuk specify context
- Middleware otomatis validate membership dan role

### Backward Compatible

- Endpoint dengan `schoolCode` di URL tetap work
- Tidak ada breaking changes pada API contract
- Handler code tidak perlu diubah

### Security Features

- Cross-tenant isolation (user tidak bisa akses school lain)
- Role-based permissions (action restricted by role)
- Fail-secure (default deny jika tidak ada role match)

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Permission-based access (granular control)
- [ ] Resource ownership check (creator-only modifications)
- [ ] Class-level access (teacher/student specific to class)
- [ ] Audit logging untuk access attempts
